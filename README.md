Splunk Security Suite

The splunk Security Suite consists of Splunk, Enterprise Security, UBA and Phantom.
As with all Splunk products these are highly customisable and can be used in a number of configurations.  Whilst this flexibility is a great strength it also adds confusion as to the best method to use the collective features and capabilities.  This project aims to offer ‘an optimal’ configuration to be used for security operations centres to implement the Splunk Security Suite.

Each Splunk security suite element has its own function, strengths and weaknesses.  To determine the optimal configuration we must first investigate these characteristics and aim to best utilise the strengths whilst avoiding the weaknesses. Further, a modern security operations centre has many responsibilities.  These responsibilities range from alarm triage to SOP creation and incident investigations.  To best utilise the Splunk Security Suite it is essential to first understand the tasks that it will be used to accomplish.

This document aims to produce a structure for using the Splunk Security Suite to best fit with the roles in most SOCs.
