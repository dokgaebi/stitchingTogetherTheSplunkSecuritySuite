# How-to-impliment-the-Splunk-Security-Suite
Splunk Security Suite

The splunk Security Suite consists of Splunk, Enterprise Security, UBA and Phantom.
As with all Splunk products these are highly customisable and can be used in a number of configurations.  Whilst this flexibility is a great strength it also adds confusion as to the best method to use the collective features and capabilities.  This project aims to offer ‘an optimal’ configuration to be used for security operations centres to implement the Splunk Security Suite.
